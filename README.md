### Lab Work 2: String Processing in Java
Made by Khylia Ivan, IP-22, variant 24

This lab work focuses on advanced string manipulation using `StringBuilder` in Java. 
The lab work is done for Variant â„– 24.

#### Features
- Sorts words starting with a vowel by the second letter, while preserving the original order for other words and punctuation.
- Validates that the input text contains only English alphabet characters and common punctuation.
- Handles text inputs using `StringBuilder`.

The TextProcessor produces an output text that preserves the original position of words starting with consonants and punctuation, while rearranging only the order of words that start with vowels. The total number of words remains unchanged.
